## Project Overview

This project covers the process of:
1. Importing and processing a dataset.
2. Using a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.
3. Saving the results to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the notebook:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow` or any other required ML framework
- Any custom utility functions for image processing (if applicable)

You can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

### Step 1: Load and Preprocess Data

The dataset used in this project consists of various entities with an `index` column. The first step involves loading the dataset and renaming columns for clarity.

- **Rename Columns**: The `Unnamed: 0` column is renamed to `index` for better readability.
  
```python
df.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'index'}, inplace=True)
```

### Step 2: Making Predictions from Test Data

A sample of the test dataset is loaded, and images are downloaded from provided URLs (if the dataset contains image links). These images are preprocessed before being used for prediction.

- **Image Download and Preprocessing**: Images from URLs are fetched and processed into a suitable format for the model to make predictions. This step requires a function to download and preprocess each image in the dataset.

- **Model Prediction**: The preprocessed images are then passed to the model to generate predictions.

```python
prediction = model.predict(data)
```

## Model Prediction

The model makes predictions on the given test data, which includes using image URLs and corresponding image processing. The predictions are then formatted to match the respective entity in the dataset.

### Step 3: Format Predictions

Once predictions are made, each row is formatted to show the `prediction` alongside the `entity_name` from the dataset.

```python
test['prediction'] = test.apply(lambda row: format_prediction(row['prediction'], row['entity_name']), axis=1)
```

## Exporting Results

### Step 4: Export Results to CSV

The final output, including the `index` and `prediction` columns, is exported to a CSV file for further use.

```python
test[['index', 'prediction']].to_csv(output_filename, index=False)
```

This step saves the prediction results to a file named `test2_out.csv`.

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully:
1. Processed a dataset by renaming columns.
2. Used a machine learning model to make predictions on test data.
3. Saved the predictions to a CSV file for future analysis.
